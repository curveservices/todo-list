## Obejective

1. The â€˜todosâ€™ are going to be objects that youâ€™ll want to dynamically create, which means either using factories or constructors/classes to generate them.
2.  At a minimum they should have a title, description, dueDate and priority. You might also want to include notes or even a checklist
3. todo list should have projects or separate lists of todos. When a user first opens the app, there should be some sort of â€˜defaultâ€™ project to which all of their todos are put. Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.
4. separate your application logic (i.e. creating new todos, setting todos as complete, changing todo priority etc.) from the DOM-related stuff, so keep all of those things in separate modules.
5. be able to do the following:
- view all projects
- view all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedateâ€¦ perhaps changing color for different priorities)
- expand a single todo to see/edit its details
- delete a todo
